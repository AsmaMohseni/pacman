# JavaFX GUI Implementation of Pac-Man
This JavaFX Pac-Man implementation is a class project from CS257 Software Design (taught by Jeff Ondich at Carleton College), completed collaboratively with Ellie Mamantov. It uses the Model-View-Controller pattern to create a well-structured application that keeps track of game state, displays current game state, and reacts to user input.
